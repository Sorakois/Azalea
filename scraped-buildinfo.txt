TESTING index10: Other Notes ² Return to Darkness offers a small utility of buff dispel, although it shouldn't be a priority if you buy the Battle Pass.³ The SPD buffs from Adversarial and River Flows in Spring are conditional, so teams with Bronya don't effectively utilise it, since speedtuning around the buff is unreliable.

If in doubt, you can try both out and see which fits the team's rotation better.³ Ice DMG% sphere is usually better than ATK%, but good substats can make up for that difference.
TESTING index10: Other Notes - The Herta should be run with at least one other Erudition character, since her Talent and A4 trace benefit significantly from it.⁴ The baseline CRIT Rate of 80% is just a baseline. It's recommended to go for as much CRIT Rate as possible, up to 100% (after accounting for any relevant in-combat buffs such as Sunday's Talent), since The Herta gains a significant amount of CRIT DMG from her A4 trace.--- For example, if The Herta gets +34% CRIT Rate in combat (perhaps due to Izumo Gensei and Takama Divine Realm + Fu Xuan's Skill + Remembrance Trailblazer's E1), then an out-of-combat CRIT Rate of around 66% would be ideal so that she reaches 100% CRIT Rate in combat.

Using Sparkle's Skill on your DPS effectively allows them to act at Sparkle's SPD.--- Since Seele's baseline SPD is very high at 143 (after considering her Skill's SPD boost), using Sparkle a bit slower than Seele's in-combat SPD is preferable.

Notes: ['Relic Notes ¹ Planetary Rendezvous and Penacony, Land of the Dreams can be used if paired with Quantum DPS.', "Other Notes ² Dance! Dance! Dance! requires extensive knowledge of speed and action value to be used efficiently, so it's not recommended for general usage.³ It is not worth prioritizing CRIT DMG over SPD, as her CRIT DMG scaling is low and more actions lead to higher damage overall.⁴ For DPS characters other than Seele, Sparkle should be built as fast as possible, while ignoring SPD on your DPS for more offensive stats. Using Sparkle's Skill on your DPS effectively allows them to act at Sparkle's SPD.--- Since Seele's baseline SPD is very high at 143 (after considering her Skill's SPD boost), using Sparkle a bit slower than Seele's in-combat SPD is preferable."]

TESTING index9: Relic Notes ¹ Planetary Rendezvous and Penacony, Land of the Dreams can be used if paired with Imaginary DPS.² Sunday wants to be slightly slower than your DPS, so the value of 2-PC SPD% sets depends on whether it helps with your speedtuning. If you aren't using 4-PC: Sacerdos' Relived Ordeal, you may want to use zero, one, or two 2-PC SPD% sets depending on how much SPD you need.
TESTING index10: Other Notes - Sunday can achieve a 3-turn Ultimate if he has an ERR% rope, a 5% ERR Planar Ornament and is hit at least once.³ A Grounded Ascent lets Sunday achieve a 3-turn Ultimate with just an ERR% rope.⁴ Dance! Dance! Dance! requires extensive knowledge of speed and action value to be used efficiently, so it's not recommended for general usage.⁵ 134 SPD Sunday (or any SPD that is slightly lower than your DPS) will be his best setup, netting you the most amount of DPS actions. The SP consumption is mitigated by Sunday's SP refund, and his Signature Light Cone A Grounded Ascent helps with it too. If SP is an issue, consider running a SP positive support or sustain (such as Gallagher).--- 160+ SPD Sunday can be used alongside either Bronya or Sparkle to hypercharge DPS actions. This will result in heavy SP consumption so this is only recommended for low SP consumption units, such as Blade.

Dance! Dance! requires extensive knowledge of speed and action value to be used efficiently, so it's not recommended for general usage.⁵ 134 SPD Sunday (or any SPD that is slightly lower than your DPS) will be his best setup, netting you the most amount of DPS actions. The SP consumption is mitigated by Sunday's SP refund, and his Signature Light Cone A Grounded Ascent helps with it too. If SP is an issue, consider running a SP positive support or sustain (such as Gallagher).--- 160+ SPD Sunday can be used alongside either Bronya or Sparkle to hypercharge DPS actions. This will result in heavy SP consumption so this is only recommended for low SP consumption units, such as Blade."]

Notes: ['Other Notes - Welt is generally best built to be a main DPS character. However, for lower investment, a pure debuffer can work but with considerably lower performance than other supports.¹ If using Before the Tutorial Mission Starts, Welt should be paired with a character that can reduce DEF, e.g. Pela or Silver Wolf.']

TESTING index7: Imaginary DMG% / ATK% ~~ Talent
TESTING index8: ATK% 3.) Ultimate
TESTING index9: Notes(Sub DPS) - March 7th generally wants to be slightly faster than her Shifu to maximize her Talent's advance. Remember to account for any in-combat SPD buffs when speedtuning, such as from March 7th's Skill and her E1. Having around 2+ SPD more than Shifu out of combat is generally safe.¹ The first 3 Light Cone options perform comparably in general, with the choice between them depending on the rest of her build and team. In the Night wants March 7th to be built with SPD (ideally 140+), while Worrisome, Blissful wants March 7th to be paired with a follow-up DPS.² 4-PC: Pioneer Diver of Dead Waters needs March 7th to use Worrisome, Blissful for it to be better than other Relic options.

TESTING index10: Other Notes - Yukong can be built as a sub DPS (going for CRIT DMG / CRIT Rate / ATK) or defensively (going for HP% / DEF%).² Past and Future and But the Battle isn't Over can only reach their full potential if Yukong is speedtuned correctly.³ E2 grants Yukong more Energy when characters reach full Energy, making it so she can get a 3-turn Ultimate with any Light Cone. Refer to the link below for more information.⁴ E6 increases Yukong's flexibility since it allows you to activate her Ultimate to gain a stack of Roaring Bowstrings at any given time.
