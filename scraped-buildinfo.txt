Alternatively, you can use HP% / DEF% on body and sphere to help his survivability, since he takes increased damage during "Standoff".
Index 10 info: Other Notes ² Return to Darkness offers a small utility of buff dispel, although it shouldn't be a priority if you buy the Battle Pass.³ The SPD buffs from Adversarial and River Flows in Spring are conditional, so teams with Bronya don't effectively utilise it, since speedtuning around the buff is unreliable. Additionally, Adversarial's low base DEF and HP may cause survivability issues for Boothill.

Index 10 info: Other Notes ³ But The Battle Isn't Over utiility is to provide extra ERR% for faster Ultimate, no need to speedtune the DMG% bonus from it.⁴ Poised to Bloom requires two DPS of the same Path in the team, e.g. Dr. Ratio and Topaz.⁵ Meshing Cogs may allow Robin to have her Ultimate back right after Concerto ends, but it's inconsistent to calculate the total energy gained by being hit.⁶ At 121 speed, Robin's A2 trace will make her first turn go before allies at 161 speed, so that she can apply her Skill's buff at the start of the battle.

Otherwise, you might want a Break Effect rope.
Index 10 info: Other Notes ⁴ Fugue wants 220% Break Effect in combat to maximize her A6 trace. She gets 30% from her A4 trace, making it 190% Break Effect required out of combat. This requirement is further lowered by 20% if Fugue is on Talia: Kingdom of Banditry, 40% if she is on Forge of the Kalpagni Lantern against Fire-weak enemies or with Firefly, 20% if Ruan Mei is in the team, and around 60% if Harmony Trailblazer is in the team.--- Reaching this value is not a strict requirement, but it does give your team an extra 24% Break Effect in combat.⁵ The value of Fugue's E2 depends on your knowledge of action value and ability to fully utilize it.

If he doesn't get hit, he will need to use a Skill instead of a Basic ATK once in this rotation.² Before the Tutorial Mission Starts ideally wants Jiaoqiu to be run with an ally who can reduce DEF, such as Pela or Black Swan.³ Solitary Healing is recommended in Pure Fiction for faster Ultimates, especially if Jiaoqiu is paired with Acheron. In this case, hitting 140% Effect Hit Rate is not necessary since most Pure Fiction enemies have low Effect RES, though he should still have 100%+ Effect Hit Rate for his debuffs to be fairly consistent.

In most other cases, ATK% boots would be slightly preferred, though this depends on the specific team and rotation. If in doubt, you can try both out and see which fits the team's rotation better.³ Ice DMG% sphere is usually better than ATK%, but good substats can make up for that difference.
Index 10 info: Other Notes - The Herta should be run with at least one other Erudition character, since her Talent and A4 trace benefit significantly from it.⁴ The baseline CRIT Rate of 80% is just a baseline. It's recommended to go for as much CRIT Rate as possible, up to 100% (after accounting for any relevant in-combat buffs such as Sunday's Talent), since The Herta gains a significant amount of CRIT DMG from her A4 trace.--- For example, if The Herta gets +34% CRIT Rate in combat (perhaps due to Izumo Gensei and Takama Divine Realm + Fu Xuan's Skill + Remembrance Trailblazer's E1), then an out-of-combat CRIT Rate of around 66% would be ideal so that she reaches 100% CRIT Rate in combat.

Index 10 info: Other Notes - Ideally, you want to spend 3-4 Skill Points before using Ultimate.- Having Qingque too slow compared to the other allies might get you Four of a Kind without spending any Skill Point but is a damage loss.² If using Yet Hope is Priceless, Qingque should ideally have at least 200% CRIT DMG after buffs (including any buffs from sources such as Sparkle's Skill).³ The Day The Cosmos Fell's ranking assumes full uptime on the CRIT DMG buff.

Index 9 info: Relic Notes ¹ Planetary Rendezvous and Penacony, Land of the Dreams can be used if paired with Imaginary DPS.² Sunday wants to be slightly slower than your DPS, so the value of 2-PC SPD% sets depends on whether it helps with your speedtuning. If you aren't using 4-PC: Sacerdos' Relived Ordeal, you may want to use zero, one, or two 2-PC SPD% sets depending on how much SPD you need.
Index 10 info: Other Notes - Sunday can achieve a 3-turn Ultimate if he has an ERR% rope, a 5% ERR Planar Ornament and is hit at least once.³ A Grounded Ascent lets Sunday achieve a 3-turn Ultimate with just an ERR% rope.⁴ Dance! Dance! Dance! requires extensive knowledge of speed and action value to be used efficiently, so it's not recommended for general usage.⁵ 134 SPD Sunday (or any SPD that is slightly lower than your DPS) will be his best setup, netting you the most amount of DPS actions. The SP consumption is mitigated by Sunday's SP refund, and his Signature Light Cone A Grounded Ascent helps with it too. If SP is an issue, consider running a SP positive support or sustain (such as Gallagher).--- 160+ SPD Sunday can be used alongside either Bronya or Sparkle to hypercharge DPS actions. This will result in heavy SP consumption so this is only recommended for low SP consumption units, such as Blade.

Index 10 info: Other Notes ⁴ Make the World Clamor [S5] lets Rappa get her Ultimate immediately after her first Skill; so even though this Light Cone does not give her any offensive stats, it performs roughly on par with After the Charmony Fall.--- If Make the World Clamor is not S5 and there are no characters in the team using Past Self in Mirror, Rappa cannot get her Ultimate immediately, so other Light Cones would be preferred.⁵ Rappa needs 3200 ATK to maximize her A6 trace's Break DMG vulnerability (up to 10%), however this is not necessary if you use a Light Cone with lower base stats, such as Passkey.- It's strongly recommended to use at least two of the following characters with Rappa: Fugue, Ruan Mei, Harmony Trailblazer. If you don't have Ruan Mei and Fugue, you can use Bronya, Sunday, March 7th (The Hunt), Silverwolf, Pela, or Jiaoqiu as a replacement.
