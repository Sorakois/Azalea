TESTING index35: Other Notes ² Return to Darkness offers a small utility of buff dispel, although it shouldn't be a priority if you buy the Battle Pass.³ The SPD buffs from Adversarial and River Flows in Spring are conditional, so teams with Bronya don't effectively utilise it, since speedtuning around the buff is unreliable.

This requirement is further lowered by 20% if Fugue is on Talia: Kingdom of Banditry, 40% if she is on Forge of the Kalpagni Lantern against Fire-weak enemies or with Firefly, 20% if Ruan Mei is in the team, and around 60% if Harmony Trailblazer is in the team.--- Reaching this value is not a strict requirement, but it does give your team an extra 24% Break Effect in combat.⁵ The value of Fugue's E2 depends on your knowledge of action value and ability to fully utilize it.

If in doubt, you can try both out and see which fits the team's rotation better.³ Ice DMG% sphere is usually better than ATK%, but good substats can make up for that difference.
TESTING index272: Other Notes - The Herta should be run with at least one other Erudition character, since her Talent and A4 trace benefit significantly from it.⁴ The baseline CRIT Rate of 80% is just a baseline. It's recommended to go for as much CRIT Rate as possible, up to 100% (after accounting for any relevant in-combat buffs such as Sunday's Talent), since The Herta gains a significant amount of CRIT DMG from her A4 trace.--- For example, if The Herta gets +34% CRIT Rate in combat (perhaps due to Izumo Gensei and Takama Divine Realm + Fu Xuan's Skill + Remembrance Trailblazer's E1), then an out-of-combat CRIT Rate of around 66% would be ideal so that she reaches 100% CRIT Rate in combat.

TESTING index718: Other Notes ⁴ Make the World Clamor [S5] lets Rappa get her Ultimate immediately after her first Skill; so even though this Light Cone does not give her any offensive stats, it performs roughly on par with After the Charmony Fall.--- If Make the World Clamor is not S5 and there are no characters in the team using Past Self in Mirror, Rappa cannot get her Ultimate immediately, so other Light Cones would be preferred.⁵ Rappa needs 3200 ATK to maximize her A6 trace's Break DMG vulnerability (up to 10%), however this is not necessary if you use a Light Cone with lower base stats, such as Passkey.- It's strongly recommended to use at least two of the following characters with Rappa: Fugue, Ruan Mei, Harmony Trailblazer. If you don't have Ruan Mei and Fugue, you can use Bronya, Sunday, March 7th (The Hunt), Silverwolf, Pela, or Jiaoqiu as a replacement.

Notes: ['Relic Notes ¹ Planetary Rendezvous and Penacony, Land of the Dreams can be used if paired with Imaginary DPS.', "Other Notes - Yukong can be built as a sub DPS (going for CRIT DMG / CRIT Rate / ATK) or defensively (going for HP% / DEF%).² Past and Future and But the Battle isn't Over can only reach their full potential if Yukong is speedtuned correctly.³ E2 grants Yukong more Energy when characters reach full Energy, making it so she can get a 3-turn Ultimate with any Light Cone. Refer to the link below for more information.⁴ E6 increases Yukong's flexibility since it allows you to activate her Ultimate to gain a stack of Roaring Bowstrings at any given time."]
