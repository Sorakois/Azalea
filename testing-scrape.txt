Notice !!!
We are aware of a glitch that occasionally causes formatting inconsistenciesto appear across random cells in the sheet.The issue isn't on our end, and we hope that it is resolved soon.For the time being, waiting for a few minutes and then refreshing the page may fix the issue.Using the "Index" section below may fix the issue too.
There is now a Terminology page.This will be kept up to date with shorthand terminology for relics.Please consult this page if you have any questions about what relic set is being refered to.

Disclaimer
This is a general guide on how to build characters and other important information.
This guide does not go into specifics on the following:
All Light Cones for a specific character.In-depth character analysis.Best teams.

Any ¹2.) Ultimate


Break Effect%~~ Basic ATK
Relic Notes¹ Boothill's main build is as a pure Break DPS, therefore body and sphere mainstat can be ignored, prioritizing Break Effect and SPD substats.--- You can use a CRIT Rate body and Physical DMG% / ATK% sphere to lean towards a hybrid build. Alternatively, you can use HP% / DEF% on body and sphere to help his survivability, since he takes increased damage during "Standoff".




Other Notes² Return to Darkness offers a small utility of buff dispel, although it shouldn't be a priority if you buy the Battle Pass.³ The SPD buffs from Adversarial and River Flows in Spring are conditional, so teams with Bronya don't effectively utilise it, since speedtuning around the buff is unreliable. Additionally, Adversarial's low base DEF and HP may cause survivability issues for Boothill.

ERR%3.) Basic ATK
Relic Notes¹ ATK% sphere provides more team-wide buff while Physical DMG% sphere increases her personal damage while in Concerto.--- Ideally, you want a sphere with Physical DMG% and high ATK% on substats, otherwise ATK% sphere is recommended.² Planetary Rendezvous and Penacony, Land of the Dreams can be used if paired with Physical DPS.




Other Notes³ But The Battle Isn't Over utiility is to provide extra ERR% for faster Ultimate, no need to speedtune the DMG% bonus from it.⁴ Poised to Bloom requires two DPS of the same Path in the team, e.g. Dr. Ratio and Topaz.⁵ Meshing Cogs may allow Robin to have her Ultimate back right after Concerto ends, but it's inconsistent to calculate the total energy gained by being hit.⁶ At 121 speed, Robin's A2 trace will make her first turn go before allies at 161 speed, so that she can apply her Skill's buff at the start of the battle.

Relic Notes¹ 4-PC: Poet of Mourning Collapse should only be used if Argenti's SPD out of combat is less than 95, and if him being this slow works with your team.² Sigonia, the Unclaimed Desolation can be used for Pure Fiction.³ Firmament Frontline: Glamoth and Rutilant Arena are more efficient sets to farm, while being slightly worse than Inert Salsotto.




Other Notes⁴ If used in Pure Fiction, Night on the Milky Way ranks higher, and would be comparable to Before Dawn.⁵ Rope depends on the team composition and the substats. That being said, both ATK% and ERR% Rope are viable options, with ATK% generally being slightly better for his personal damage.

Relic Notes¹ Solitary Healing and 4-PC: Thief of Shooting Meteor are for Pure Fiction.² Forge of the Kalpagni Lantern is preferable if against Fire-weak enemies or with Firefly.³ ERR% rope is recommended if Fugue has her E2 or if you already have enough Break Effect to hit 220% Break Effect in combat. Otherwise, you might want a Break Effect rope.




Other Notes⁴ Fugue wants 220% Break Effect in combat to maximize her A6 trace. She gets 30% from her A4 trace, making it 190% Break Effect required out of combat. This requirement is further lowered by 20% if Fugue is on Talia: Kingdom of Banditry, 40% if she is on Forge of the Kalpagni Lantern against Fire-weak enemies or with Firefly, 20% if Ruan Mei is in the team, and around 60% if Harmony Trailblazer is in the team.--- Reaching this value is not a strict requirement, but it does give your team an extra 24% Break Effect in combat.⁵ The value of Fugue's E2 depends on your knowledge of action value and ability to fully utilize it.

Otherwise, Fleet of the Ageless, Broken Keel or Lushaka, the Sunken Seas is preferred.³ Penacony, Land of the Dreams can be used if paired with Fire DPS other than Firefly.




Other Notes- Lingsha's A2 trace requires 200% Break Effect to be maximized, though maximizing it isn't necessary.⁴ Echoes of the Coffin can shorten Lingsha's Ultimate to 2 turns if enough enemies are hit and can outperform her signature LC, Scent Alone Stays True, in Pure Fiction.⁵ Night of Fright requires an ERR% rope or a 5% ERR Planar Ornament set to have a 3-turn Ultimate rotation.⁶ If using S3/S4 Post-Op Conversation + a 5% ERR Planar Ornament set, or S5 Post-Op Conversation, you can use a Break Effect rope while maintaining a 3-turn Ultimate rotation. S1-S4 Post-Op Conversation will also allow for a 3-turn Ultimate as long as Lingsha gets hit once and can let you use a Break Effect rope.

Relic Notes¹ 4-PC: Prisoner in Deep Confinement and Firmament Frontline: Glamoth can be used to increase personal damage, especially at E2.




Other Notes- Jiaoqiu wants 140% Effect Hit Rate to maximize the ATK buff from his A4 trace.- Jiaoqiu needs an ERR% rope for 3-turn Ultimate, following a 1 Skill + 2 Basic ATK rotation if he gets hit during these 3 turns. If he doesn't get hit, he will need to use a Skill instead of a Basic ATK once in this rotation.² Before the Tutorial Mission Starts ideally wants Jiaoqiu to be run with an ally who can reduce DEF, such as Pela or Black Swan.³ Solitary Healing is recommended in Pure Fiction for faster Ultimates, especially if Jiaoqiu is paired with Acheron. In this case, hitting 140% Effect Hit Rate is not necessary since most Pure Fiction enemies have low Effect RES, though he should still have 100%+ Effect Hit Rate for his debuffs to be fairly consistent.

Other Notes² Firefly needs 150 SPD to take 4 actions inside Combustion state, with Ultimate level 10 giving 60 more SPD (210+ is needed inside the state). Ruan Mei's Talent at level 10 can lower this requirement to 140.- It's strongly recommended to use at least two of the following characters with Firefly: Ruan Mei, Fugue, Harmony Trailblazer. If you don't have Ruan Mei and Fugue, you can use March 7th (The Hunt), Jiaoqiu, or Pela as a replacement.

Relic Notes¹ Sigonia, the Unclaimed Desolation can be used for Pure Fiction.² If The Herta is paired with Sunday or Bronya, SPD boots would be preferred. In most other cases, ATK% boots would be slightly preferred, though this depends on the specific team and rotation. If in doubt, you can try both out and see which fits the team's rotation better.³ Ice DMG% sphere is usually better than ATK%, but good substats can make up for that difference.




Other Notes- The Herta should be run with at least one other Erudition character, since her Talent and A4 trace benefit significantly from it.⁴ The baseline CRIT Rate of 80% is just a baseline. It's recommended to go for as much CRIT Rate as possible, up to 100% (after accounting for any relevant in-combat buffs such as Sunday's Talent), since The Herta gains a significant amount of CRIT DMG from her A4 trace.--- For example, if The Herta gets +34% CRIT Rate in combat (perhaps due to Izumo Gensei and Takama Divine Realm + Fu Xuan's Skill + Remembrance Trailblazer's E1), then an out-of-combat CRIT Rate of around 66% would be ideal so that she reaches 100% CRIT Rate in combat.

Other Notes¹ The baseline CRIT Rate of 40% is just a baseline.

Other Notes- All Light Cone options below Reforged Remembrance are roughly on par with one another. They are also rather difficult to rank because of the many factors in her kit as well as your current stats on Black Swan.--- If you're lacking in Effect Hit Rate, going for Incessant Rain, Eyes of the Prey, or Before the Tutorial Mission Starts can be better than other Light Cones.³ Black Swan wants 120% Effect Hit Rate to maximize the DMG buff from her A6 trace.

Other Notes² At Ultimate level 10, 50% Crit DMG on Bronya is only an 8% Crit DMG increase on her Ultimate buff. The scaling is not high enough to make it a priority over SPD.³ Bronya essentially has 2 builds. You either make her slightly slower then your DPS, as close to their SPD as possible (Slow Bronya, also referred to as -1 Bronya) or you make her as fast as possible and ignore SPD on the DPS (Fast Bronya).--- Slow Bronya is recommended to have around 134 SPD, while Fast Bronya is recommended to have 160+ SPD.

Other NotesBoth Algaea and Garmentmaker deal damage in similar ratio, which makes them prefer buffs that can affect both of them, like Robin, Sunday, Trailblazer (Remembrance).¹ For Optimal Speed Tuning with Time Woven into Gold & if using with Bronya / Sunday, it is suggested to have be half of Aglaea's SPD in her Supreme Stance. For Further Optimization, getting Aglaea to 160 SPD out of Combat lets you run 134 Speed Bronya / Sunday, Although this is not recommended due to the amount of other stats you would have to lose for this.

Relic Notes¹ 4-PC: Poet of Mourning Collapse should only be used if Acheron's SPD out of combat is less than 95, and if she is not paired with a support that wants her to be fast (such as a -1 Sunday).² Use ATK% feet if Sparkle is in the team, and SPD feet if Sunday or Bronya is in the team.--- If none of the above are in the team, ATK% feet generally performs better than SPD feet, unless your SPD feet has 3 or more substat rolls compared to ATK% (includes CRIT Rate, CRIT DMG and ATK%).³ The difference between ATK% sphere and Lightning DMG% sphere is minimal, so going for the one that has better substats is recommended.




Other Notes- If using her Signature Light Cone Along The Passing Shore, you can replace one Nihility support with Sparkle or Sunday, even if Acheron is E0-E1. Robin or -1 SPD Bronya can work as well, but you might have Skill Point issues.- Preservation characters in a team with Acheron may use Trend of the Universal Market, though this is not important if Jiaoqiu is also in the team.

Relic Notes¹ With 4-PC: Poet of Mourning Collapse, Jade cannot have any SPD substats for her to be slower than 95 SPD.² Sigonia, the Unclaimed Desolation should only be used for Pure Fiction.




Other Notes- Jade's Skill should be used on allies who can perform frequent AoE attacks, such as Herta, Himeko, Blade, etc.³ The baseline CRIT Rate of 80% is just a baseline. It's recommended to go for as much CRIT Rate as possible, up to 100% (after accounting for any relevant in-combat buffs such as Fu Xuan's Skill), since Jade gains a significant amount of CRIT DMG from her Talent.⁴ Jade's E1 allows her to be used more effectively in MoC and AS compositions, with single target allies such as Dr. Ratio and Topaz.

Using Sparkle's Skill on your DPS effectively allows them to act at Sparkle's SPD.--- Since Seele's baseline SPD is very high at 143 (after considering her Skill's SPD boost), using Sparkle a bit slower than Seele's in-combat SPD is preferable.

Relic Notes¹ 4-PC: Poet of Mourning Collapse should only be used if Seele is not on her Signature LC In the Night or is E2+, since the SPD reduction would be detrimental for In the Night without her E2's SPD boost to compensate. Additionally, check that Seele's SPD out of combat is lower than 110 in this case.- All 4 Planar Set options are within ~3% of each other and so any can be used with a negligible difference in performance.² The difference between ATK% sphere and Quantum DMG% sphere is minimal, so going for the one that has better substats is recommended.




Other Notes³ For E0/E1 Seele, In the Night requires 132 SPD to maximize its effect, but it's recommended to use ATK% feet and aim for 122 speed with substats. If Seele is on another Light Cone, you don't need any SPD on her.

Other Notes- Ideally, you want to spend 3-4 Skill Points before using Ultimate.- Having Qingque too slow compared to the other allies might get you Four of a Kind without spending any Skill Point but is a damage loss.² If using Yet Hope is Priceless, Qingque should ideally have at least 200% CRIT DMG after buffs (including any buffs from sources such as Sparkle's Skill).³ The Day The Cosmos Fell's ranking assumes full uptime on the CRIT DMG buff.

Relic Notes¹ Planetary Rendezvous and Penacony, Land of the Dreams can be used if paired with Imaginary DPS.² Sunday wants to be slightly slower than your DPS, so the value of 2-PC SPD% sets depends on whether it helps with your speedtuning. If you aren't using 4-PC: Sacerdos' Relived Ordeal, you may want to use zero, one, or two 2-PC SPD% sets depending on how much SPD you need.




Other Notes- Sunday can achieve a 3-turn Ultimate if he has an ERR% rope, a 5% ERR Planar Ornament and is hit at least once.³ A Grounded Ascent lets Sunday achieve a 3-turn Ultimate with just an ERR% rope.⁴ Dance! Dance! Dance! requires extensive knowledge of speed and action value to be used efficiently, so it's not recommended for general usage.⁵ 134 SPD Sunday (or any SPD that is slightly lower than your DPS) will be his best setup, netting you the most amount of DPS actions. The SP consumption is mitigated by Sunday's SP refund, and his Signature Light Cone A Grounded Ascent helps with it too. If SP is an issue, consider running a SP positive support or sustain (such as Gallagher).--- 160+ SPD Sunday can be used alongside either Bronya or Sparkle to hypercharge DPS actions. This will result in heavy SP consumption so this is only recommended for low SP consumption units, such as Blade.

Relic Notes¹ 4-PC: Iron Cavalry Against the Scourge is the best option when there are a few enemies with high toughness and HP (such as in Memory of Chaos / Apocalyptic Shadow).² 4-PC: Thief of Shooting Meteor is the best option when there are multiple enemies that can be quickly broken (such as in Pure Fiction), allowing Rappa to have permanent Ultimate uptime.³ 2-PC: Forge of the Kalpagni Lantern is an option against Fire-weak enemies.




Other Notes⁴ Make the World Clamor [S5] lets Rappa get her Ultimate immediately after her first Skill; so even though this Light Cone does not give her any offensive stats, it performs roughly on par with After the Charmony Fall.--- If Make the World Clamor is not S5 and there are no characters in the team using Past Self in Mirror, Rappa cannot get her Ultimate immediately, so other Light Cones would be preferred.⁵ Rappa needs 3200 ATK to maximize her A6 trace's Break DMG vulnerability (up to 10%), however this is not necessary if you use a Light Cone with lower base stats, such as Passkey.- It's strongly recommended to use at least two of the following characters with Rappa: Fugue, Ruan Mei, Harmony Trailblazer. If you don't have Ruan Mei and Fugue, you can use Bronya, Sunday, March 7th (The Hunt), Silverwolf, Pela, or Jiaoqiu as a replacement.

Other Notes- Ranking takes into consideration the effective HP + damage provided by each Light Cone.² A Sub DPS build is possible if Aventurine has his Signature Light Cone Inherently Unjust Destiny. In this case, try for 32%+ CRIT Rate and 140%+ CRIT DMG after reaching 4000+ DEF.--- This isn't recommended if you don't have Aventurine's Signature Light Cone.

It is also generally less efficient to farm than the alternatives.³ Unless paired with Sparkle, SPD boots can perform better if your team can generate enough Skill Points for Imbibitor Lunae.⁴ The difference between ATK% sphere and Imaginary DMG% sphere is minimal, so going for the one that has better substats is recommended.

Other Notes- You can use HP% / DEF% body and sphere if facing survivability issues, since his healing kit is strong enough to not need high ATK% stats.² Multiplication is ranked higher than most dedicated healing Light Cones due to Luocha's kit already providing enough sustain, resulting in the advance forward having more value.³ Perfect Timing at any superimposition requires 30% Effect RES (before adding the Light Cone) to maximize the Outgoing Healing.⁴ Shared Feeling and 4-PC: Sacerdos' Relived Ordeal can be viable options for Luocha in teams that generate enough Skill Points for him to spam his Skill--- Note that these effects only trigger when Luocha uses his Skill actively. His automatic Skill triggers do not trigger the Energy regeneration from Shared Feeling or the CRIT DMG buff from 4-PC: Sacerdos' Relived Ordeal.

Other Notes- Welt is generally best built to be a main DPS character. However, for lower investment, a pure debuffer can work but with considerably lower performance than other supports.¹ If using Before the Tutorial Mission Starts, Welt should be paired with a character that can reduce DEF, e.g. Pela or Silver Wolf.

Notes(Sub DPS)- March 7th generally wants to be slightly faster than her Shifu to maximize her Talent's advance. Remember to account for any in-combat SPD buffs when speedtuning, such as from March 7th's Skill and her E1. Having around 2+ SPD more than Shifu out of combat is generally safe.¹ The first 3 Light Cone options perform comparably in general, with the choice between them depending on the rest of her build and team. In the Night wants March 7th to be built with SPD (ideally 140+), while Worrisome, Blissful wants March 7th to be paired with a follow-up DPS.² 4-PC: Pioneer Diver of Dead Waters needs March 7th to use Worrisome, Blissful for it to be better than other Relic options.




For general use, where March 7th is usually paired with another DPS, go with her Sub DPS build. Her Super Break build requires Harmony Trailblazer to be in the team.

Notes(Super Break DPS)¹ Body and sphere mainstats are less important, prioritizing Break Effect and SPD substats is recommended instead.--- You can use a CRIT Rate body and Imaginary DMG% / ATK% sphere to lean towards a hybrid build. Alternatively, you can use HP% / DEF% on body and sphere to help her survivability.- March 7th should be paired with Harmony Trailblazer or Fugue. If going against non-Imaginary-weak enemies, she should also be paired with a Harmony/Nihility/Abundance/Preservation character whose element matches the enemies' weaknesses, and choose that ally as her Shifu. For example, she can use her Skill on Gallagher against Fire-weak enemies.

Other Notes- Yukong can be built as a sub DPS (going for CRIT DMG / CRIT Rate / ATK) or defensively (going for HP% / DEF%).² Past and Future and But the Battle isn't Over can only reach their full potential if Yukong is speedtuned correctly.³ E2 grants Yukong more Energy when characters reach full Energy, making it so she can get a 3-turn Ultimate with any Light Cone. Refer to the link below for more information.⁴ E6 increases Yukong's flexibility since it allows you to activate her Ultimate to gain a stack of Roaring Bowstrings at any given time.
